# User-behaviour-analysis
This study focuses on exploratory data analysis to identify behavioural patterns 
in using an interactive tool on a fertility education platform (the “Your Fertility” website). 
A dataset of 4245 people (84% women and 16% men) who voluntarily accessed the online Healthy Conception Tool (HCT) on the “Your Fertility” website was analysed. 
Depending on the types of variables, the paper used certain statistical techniques 
including Pearson correlation coefficient, Scatter plot, Chi-Squared Test, Bonferroni correction, One-hot encoding, and Point Biserial Correlation.
