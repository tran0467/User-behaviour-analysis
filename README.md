# Purpose

Understanding user’s behavioural patterns while using a certain website can lead to
improved website design with more personalized features, or more precisely targeted
marketing campaigns. Various papers have been conducted to find the user’s
behavioural patterns in the online health platforms, but the majority of them just focus
on totally or partially offline behaviours. 

# Project
This study focuses on exploratory data analysis to identify behavioural patterns in using an interactive tool on a fertility
education platform (the “Your Fertility” website). A dataset of 4245 people (84%
women and 16% men) who voluntarily accessed the online Healthy Conception Tool
(HCT) on the “Your Fertility” website was analysed. 

# Techniques
Depending on the types of variables, the paper used certain statistical techniques including Pearson correlation
coefficient, Scatter plot, Chi-Squared Test, Bonferroni correction, One-hot encoding,
and Point Biserial Correlation. 

# Results
The paper indicated that the modified profile (the last
input of users) has a greater number of correlations than the initial profile (the first
input of users), which supports the “linear slider format” issue. Besides, this analysis
shows the significant gender differences in behaviours related to age and weight
directions, between people having children and no children, and between people
having STI (Sexually transmitted infections) test and not. Also, Principal Component
Analysis and K-means clustering were applied to figure out the user’s behaviours in
groups.
